\chapter{The ATLAS Detector}

ATLAS is a system of particle detectors built to
measure collisions of both proton-proton and heavy ion collisions
generated by the LHC. \cite{atlas-detector-2008} The entire detector
is $44~m$ long and $25~m$ in diameter. It consists of an inner
detector subsystem for charged particle tracking and electron
identification, both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a
muon spectrometer.

\section{Coordinates}
The coordinate system used in this document is the standard ATLAS
coordinate system, which is defined in this section. For both Cartesian and
polar coordinates, the origin is defined as the nominal interaction
point. The z-axis points down the beamline. The x-y plane is
perpendicular to the beamline. The positive y-direction points up, and
the positive x-direction points towads the center of the LHC ring. The
positive z-direction therefore points counterclockwise along the LHC,
when view from above, as required by a right-handed coordinate system.

For cylindrical coordinates, the z-axis is defined the same way as for
Cartesian coordinates. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is the angle
from the positive x-axis, while the polar angle $\theta$ is the angle
from the beamline.

A more convenient measure of angle from the beamline is the
\textit{rapidity}, because rapidity differences are invariant under Lorentz boosts in the
z-direction. The rapidity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z}
\end{equation}

Another frequently used quantity is the
\textit{pseudorapidity}, which is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\eta = -\ln\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{equation}

Pseudorapidity differences are also invariant with respect to
longitudinal Lorentz boosts. In the limit where $p_T << m$, rapidity and
pseudorapidity are equal.

Pseudorapidity ranges from $\eta=0$, which is perpendicular to the
beamline, up to $\eta=\inf$, which is parallel to the beamline.

Finally, a distance measure in $\eta-\phi$ space is often used. This
distance, $\Delta R$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta\eta^2+\Delta\phi^2}
\end{equation}

\section{Magnet System}

\section{Inner Detector}

The inner detector consists of silicon pixel detectors, silicon strip
detectors, and transition radiation trackers. It covers a region from
$R = 33~mm$ to $R = 1082~mm$ and $|\eta| = 0$ to $|\eta| = 2.5$. The entire inner
detector is immersed in a $2~T$ magnetic field, generated by a
solenoid coil which surrounds it. The layout of inner detector
subsystems is shown in figure \ref{fig:inner_detector_quarter}.

\subsection{Pixel Detector}

The innermost layer of ATLAS is the pixel detector system. It consists
of 1744 pixel sensors, arranged into a barrel region and two endcap
regions. In total, there are 80.4 million readout channels.

\subsubsection{Layout}
The barrel region consists of four
concentric cylindrical layers, coaxial with the beamline. The two endcap regions are each made up
of three disks, arranged perpendicular to the beamline.

The pixel barrel envelope covers a region
from $z = 0$ to $|z|  = 400.5~mm$. The four layers are located at
increasing distances from the beamline, at $R = 33~mm, 50.5~mm,
88.5~mm, 122.5~mm$.

The six endcap disks are located at $|z| = 495~mm, 580~mm, 650~mm$
and cover the region $88.8~mm < R < 149.6~mm$.

The silicon strip tracker (SCT) is also segmented into a barrel and
two endcap regions.
