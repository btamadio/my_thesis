    Supersymmetry, one of the of the most promising extensions to the Standard Model of Particle Physics,
    predicts a number of as-yet-undiscovered particles, evidence of which could be found in LHC collision events.
    This thesis presents a search for R-parity violating Supersymmetric signal events in ATLAS proton-proton collision data.
    The search uses $36.1~fb^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13~TeV$ collision data, taken by ATLAS in 2015 and 2016.
    As no excess of events above the background prediction was found, limits are set on the production cross sections
    of gluinos and neutralinos under two different decay scenarios.
    The resulting limits are a significant extension beyond the reach of the Run-1 search for the same process.
